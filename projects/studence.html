            <h3>What was the customer's <b>Problem</b>?</h3>
            <p>
              Imagine the future, every high schooler knows what they want to
              study in college, what professions they want to pursue. Right now,
              most high schoolers donâ€™t. And it is not easy for them to find a
              right person who can give a personal advice on finding an
              appropriate major or college to go to.
            </p>

            <h3>What was my <b>Task</b>?</h3>
            <p>
              My task was to create a prototype service to solve the problem and
              to manage running a pilot program to validate the value we
              deliver. This idea was a startup project to propose and validate a
              new business idea, officially authroized by Sony R&D. I also
              pitched this idea with team of 4 members in the
              <a
                href="https://scet.berkeley.edu/professional-programs/engineering-leadership-professional-program-silicon-valley-in-person/"
                target="_blank"
                >Engineering Leadership Professional Program</a
              >, an academic program at University of California, Berkeley.
            </p>

            <h3>What <b>Actions</b> did I take?</h3>
            <p>
              I pitchted the idea to the senior management in Sony R&D and got
              funded to develop the beta service. I worked with a few iOS
              engineers and outsourcing design agency to prototype different
              versions to test it out. During the prototyping and pilot phase,
              my task is to 1. define requirements based on customer's voice, 2.
              manage development sprint, 3. conduct user test with customers,
              and 4. grow the service user base. To effectively conduct these
              tasks, I collaborated with cross-functional team including
              engineers, designers, marketers, as well as some college student
              interns.
            </p>

            <h3>What was the <b>Result</b>?</h3>
            <p>
              I managed a 6-month pilot, then pivoted the value proposition
              several times based on fail and learn. The most important finding
              is our main customer was not the one we originally targeted but
              different stakeholders so we pivited the business model from 2C to
              2B.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the 6-month pilot, our team looked for the business unit
              that could take over this service to grow the business. We had
              several options such as running the business in Sony, spin out to
              a start up compnay, joint-venture opportunity with a partner
              company, selling our or licensing the technolgy to 3rd parties and
              so on. We ended up selling our technology to an educational
              non-profit organization that gave us an accruing proposal. This
              project became the first R&D project in Sony that exited to an
              outside company.

            <h3>What was the customer's <b>Problem</b>?</h3>
            <p>
              Did you know 1 in every 8 youth is not in education, employment,
              or training in the US? A county office of education was looking
              for a technical solution to improve the situation. They had a big
              idea to create a mobile app but they didn't know what to do to
              take action.
            </p>

            <h3>What was my <b>Task</b>?</h3>
            <p>
              My task was to understand their vision, ideas, and challlenges,
              then to co-create the best solution. This was a startup project to
              propose and validate a new business idea, officially authroized by
              Sony R&D.
            </p>

            <h3>What <b>Actions</b> did I take?</h3>
            <p>
              I listened to each stakeholder's needs, gathered feedback, and
              brought everyone in the same table to brainstorm the most critical
              challenges. Important thing is to understand why the challenges
              have not been solved, then to make the same understanding of the
              most important features needed in our solution. The agreeed top 3
              challenges were:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Opportunities and Social Resources were scattered everywhere.
                Youth even didn't know what support exists.
              </li>
              <li>
                The process of applying for opportunities is complicated and
                time consuming.
              </li>
              <li>
                Educators weren't able to measure the impact of each opportunity
                and resource.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              To solve these problems, I developed a web application system that
              has the following features:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Centrilized Resources: Educators can manage all opportunities
                and social resources into one centrilzed repository that can be
                accessed by all other educators and youth. Educators can share
                available resources to their youth through the app. Youth can
                explore opportunities and resources on the mobile web app.
              </li>
              <li>
                Easy Apply: Youth can easily apply for an opportunity on the app
                by attaching necessary documents.
              </li>
              <li>
                Measure Impact: Educators can view what opportunities and
                resources are in need by youth based on the access and usage of
                the app.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What was the <b>Result</b>?</h3>
            <p>
              I managed a 1-year pilot working with cross-functional teams,
              customers, and educational partners including non profit youth
              serving organizations. By setting up some KPIs to measure the
              success, my team tracked Net Promote Score, active usage, and
              number of youth users and organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pilot succeeded after countless iterations of feature
              development and UX improvements. The customer appreciated the
              solution we developed, ending up becoming a paying customer for 1
              year contract. To scale the business, I worked with our marketing
              team to promote to other county office of educations, cities, and
              youth-serving organizations. Unfortunatel, we could not find
              additional customers within 1 year, ending up closing the project
              upon running out of budget.

            <h3>System Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              There are three systems of persistent data storage for this
              solution:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Database for user information with storing public keys,
                encrypted private keys, and other entity data. We chose AWS
                PostgreSQL as those data are structured information and ACID
                required.
              </li>
              <li>
                Database for storing encrypted documents. We used an cloud
                strorage.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stand-in database for storing permissions and encrypted document
                keys.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We designed the distributed system by storing encrypted data and
              keys in different data base systems in order to protect senstive
              data such as ID, SSN etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              The API sets are implemented in the NodeJS application server.
              They are just two different sets of endpoints in separate
              services. Here is the system block architecture:
